Intro to Flexbox
1D layout method for laying out items in rows or columns
Allows you to distribute space dynamically accross elements of an unknown size, hence the term "flex".
two axes in a Flexbox
        Main axis - left to right
        Cross axis - top to bottom

Properties
    display: flex
    Main Axis
        flex-direction: allows you to change the direction of the main axis
            row
            row-reverse
            column
            column-reverse
        justify-content: how the content is distributed across the axis
            flex-start
            flex-end
            center
            space-between
            space-around
            space-evenly
        flex-wrap: determines whether elements are going to wrap along the main axis onto a new line or a new column
            nowrap
            wrap
            wrap-reverse
    Cross Axis
        align-items: distribute items along the cross axis
            flex-start
            baseline
        align-content: control or distribute space on the cross-axis when we have mulitple rows or columns
            flex-start
            flex-end
            center
            space-between
            space-around
            space-evenly
        align-self: property applied to individual items in the flexbox; change the alignment along the cross-axis for that item
            same values as align content but applied to that one element only
    Others for individual items in a flex container
        flex-basis: defines the initial size of an element before additional space is distributed
        flex-grow: controls the amount of available space an element should take up. Accepts a unit-less number value.
            when there is extra space in the container
        flex-shrink: if items are larger than the container, they shrink according to flex-shrink
            when there is not enough space in the container

Flex Shorthand property
    one value, unitless number: flex-grow
    one value, width/height number+unit: flex-basis
    two values
        flex-grow | flex-basis
    two-values
        flex-grow | flex-shrink
    three-values
        flex-grow | flex-shrink | flex-basis
    
Responsive Design and Media Queries
    Responsive design - Making a site that is able to respond to the device it is displayed on
    Media Queries - features that we can write into our CSS that allow us to change our styles or add new styles depending on some parameter; commonly screen width, etc.

Media Queries
    @media (<media-features>: value) {
        <apply styles>
    }
