CSS Units revisited
Relative
    EM - usefull for scaling elements based on some other element or itself scaling (keeping a rounded button the same shape despite changing size)
        with font size, 1em is the font-size of the parent. 2 em's is twice the font-size of the parent
        with other properties, 1em is equal to the computed font-size of the element itself
    REM (root html element) - when you need to avoid nested scaling use rem to keep size relative to the root element
    % - relative to some other value depending on the type of element
        width - 50% half the width of the parent
        line-height - 50% half the font-size
Absolute
    px -exactly what you set it to
