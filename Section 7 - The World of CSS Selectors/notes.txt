CSS Selectors

So far we have been applying styles to general html elements like a paragraph <p>. CSS selectors are a way to apply styles to specific elements rather than all paragraph elements we can apply it to a single target element.

Universal Selectors
Selects everything in the document to add style to it. Denoted by a '*'.

Element Selectors
Select all elements of a type

Selector List
Use a comma separated list to select multiple elements to apply the same style to

ID selectors
'#' for an id
Select a specific element based on its id attribute which you specify in the html.

Class Selector
'.' for a class
A class refers to a class of elements which can makeup any combination of html elements.
The class selector will apply a style to all elements of that class.

Descendant selector
Example:
Selects all anchor tags that are descendants of an li 
li a {
    color: teal;
}
Note the space between element types denotes a descendant selector
Use this if you want all anchor tags within a list to look the same but not necessarily all anchor tags on the page.

Adjacent Selector
Selects all elements b adjacent to element a
a + b {
    color: green;
}

Direct-Descendant Selector
Selects all elements b that are direct descendants and direct descendants only of element a
a > b {
    color: blue;
}

Attribute Selector
Select all elements a that contain the attribute of some value
input[type="text"] {
    width: 300px;
    color: yellow;
}

Pseudo-classes
A keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific state of the selected element(s). For example, the pseudo-class :hover can be used to select a button when a user's pointer hovers over the button and this selected button can be styled.
Denoted by a ':' colon
button:hover {
    background-color: blue;
}

Pseudo-elements
a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s)
Denoted by a '::' double colon
selector::pseudo-element {
    property: value;
}
p::first-line {
    color: blue;
    text-transform: uppercase;
}

The CSS Cascade
The order your styles are declared in and linked to matters!
h1 {
    color: red;
}
h1 {
    color: purple;
}
Purple wins!

Specificity
How the browser decides which rules to apply when multiple rules could apply to the same element.
It is a measure of how specific a given selector is. The more specific selector wins!
